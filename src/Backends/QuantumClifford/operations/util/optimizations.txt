Some notes on measurement optimizations:


- make the sparse measurement functions type stable by always returning an UInt8 (instead of nothing we return UInt8(3))

- reuse a Pauli operator in the case of "everything commutes" to not allocate a new one.

- replace the get index of Tableau, which creates a new PauliOperator object with a direct matrix element wise copy
once for the promote logical row case and once for the there is an anticommuting stabilizer case.

e.g.:
# tab[r+1] = tab[n+r+1]          # copy promoted row
xz = @view tab.xzs[:,n+r+1]
phases = tab.phases[n+r+1]
tab.xzs[:,r+1] .= xz
tab.phases[r+1] = phases[]

-> no allocations
